-  Currently, I am commenting my code for easier reuse and pruning unnecessary bloat
 -  Take the images generated and pass them to a moderator for NSFW check
 -  Allow viewers to tell bot which AI to use (along with novelAI image gen 
        functionality implementation)
 -  Create login for main program (at this point, novelAI will likely be the only
        story gen, AI Dungeon API seems relatively abandoned and less complex in story)
 -  Less directed, open to suggestions
 -  Let viewers submit images through the bot (would still go through the moderator)
